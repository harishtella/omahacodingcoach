# Omaha Coding Coach

### If you are learning how to program, I can help you get there faster.

Hi, my name is Harish. I am an Omaha native, and I
have been a writing code for most of my life. I want to help you by
offering one-on-one personalized teaching sessions on topics
requested by you.

### Who is this for?
- You want to build prototypes for your business ideas.
- You want to get a job in the industry.
- You want to know how modern web-applications work.
- You want to know what makes a good programmer, so you can hire them.

### How it works
You let me know ahead of time what you are interseted in working on. And
I'll prepare a personalized lesson for you. This may be a walkthrough of
new code I've written for you or a walkthrough of edits on your code. Or we may
explore a particular concept or technology together. We will end with
something concrete you can work on - a programming assignment.

### Things we might work on

##### Some code your that is just not working or you want to improve.
We can work through debugging it together, so you can learn my process.
Then I'll share strategies to assure that similar bugs don't crop up
again.

##### A computer science concept you just can't get.
I can break it down to you visually. I can show you real world
examples of the concept at work. And I can devise exercises that will
solidify and test your understanding.

##### Some aspect of git that just confuses you.
You're not alone. Git is best understood in pictures while
simultaneously going through the commands. We will work through cases,
and it'll all make sense.

##### You want to understand the difference between different types of languages.
Beyond syntax what's the difference between Javascript, Java, and C.
What makes some languages faster than others. I can help you
understand.

##### You want style advice on code.
Style is one the biggest things people look at when determining whether your code is professional or not. It is hard to gauge your own code's quality and style. An experienced eye can help you make the right changes.

##### You don't entirely get Object Oriented Design.
Ok, no problem. Let's work through some examples. We'll get the bigger
picture. And then move on to something concrete you can work on, on your own.

##### You want to know how you can get better or what to work on next in order to secure a job.
Nothing helps more than the guidance and advice of someone who has
already been there.

##### And whatever else you can think of.

### Why might one-on-one lessons with me be better than a coding bootcamp?

Having taught at a coding bootcamp, I can say it can be a transformative
experience for the right person. But it is like drinking from the
firehouse. There is an immense amount of information in a short period of time.
If you can't keep up, you're left behind.

In addition to all this, a coding bootcamp costs between $9,000 and
$20,000, and you'll have to quit your job. This is not the right way to find
out if you want to write code for a living. Working with me, you can
level-up on your own before you take any bigger moves. And maybe a few
lessons is all you need.

### Why is one-on-one with me better than working alone?

There are so many free resources for learning how to code on web today. But
doing it alone can be such a challenge. It is easy to get caught up in
things that don't matter. And it is hard to know whether you are doing
things the right way or not. A coach can help you stay on track and stay
motivated. I truly believe that the most valuable thing I have to offer
is not my technichal skills, but my belief in your ability to exceed your
own expectations.

### Here are things past students have said about me.

> Very good use of diagrams. Realllllly simplified my understanding of git. And all-around seems like a very chill/nice guy. Someone I can see myself hanging out with. His one-on-one teaching is superb, and he has a very minimalist way of teaching-- I mean that in a very good way. It's almost like he's practicing jujitsu and throwing down massive knowledge with minimal effort…”     

> Harish is so sweet and calm and wonderful!  I think that he is especially good about explaining difficult concepts…”   

> Harish does an excellent job of pre-judging what are going to be difficult points that beginners might run into and often is able to find a way to resolve those concerns before they arise…”   

> I can see he has a vast knowledge and background in programming….
